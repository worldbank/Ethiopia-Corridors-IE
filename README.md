There are two main high-level folders: (1) `DataWork` and (2) `Functions`. Others may be added as the project expands (e.g., a folder for `Dashboard`). 

## DataWork

This folder is for data cleaning and analysis. The high-level folders are the same as the folders in the `Data` folder in Dropbox. For example, LSMS data is in `[Dropbox]/Data/LSMS`, and code for working with the LSMS data is in `[Github]/DataWork/LSMS`.

Key folders include:
* __Panel Data RSDP Impacts:__ Includes code for prepping data and analysis for examining the impact of the RSDP on local economic activity and land cover. While the data primarily relies on DMSP and woreda level data as the main unit of analysis, code and data are included here to keep everything for this activity in one place. 

## Functions

The `Functions` folder is for any general functions that may be used throughout the project and for multiple datasets. Any dataset specific function should go in the appropriate folder in `DataWork`. Included in the `Functions` folder are any external packages or libraries used for the project that need to be locally downloaded.
